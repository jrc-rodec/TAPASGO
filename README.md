# TAPASGO Resources
Resources used to fine-tune the TAPAS-base model for a potential German TAPAS model (TAPASGO)

## UI Data Collector

In order to collect data for the fine-tuning process of TAPASGO, a self-developed tool for annotating tabular data was created. 
The tool consists of two subprojects: 
* a __back-end__ that is responsible for the data processing
* a __front-end__ where a user can input answers for a given table row
 The subprojects can be found inside the data-collector folder.

### Front-End

### Backend

## Training

All files used for the training process, including the data and Jupyter Notebook, can be found inside the training folder.
Inside there all experiments can be validated.
